        <p>
          This website is here for anyone to check a bunch of things in
          rocketbotroyale

        <p>
          Just enter in your user ID, and with that you can view your stats and
          your estimated skill level. Or you can enter in a certain season to
          view the top 50 in that season (note: this only works with season 11
          to the most current season).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also check my code to see how good you are, this code just
          does some simple math to get your skill based on your stats. Keep in
          mind this isn't always accurate, and that some players are better than
          their stats show, whilst others are worse.
        </p>

            IF YOU ENTER IN YOUR USER ID WRONG IN CHECK SKILL IT BREAKS FOR A

        <p></p>

          Pressing the get all placement button with a desired placment will get
          everyone that has gotten that placement, (with duplicates).
        </p>
        <p>
          Pressing the Search user will find every user in every season that has
          gotten the top 50, and return it. It also has duplicates.
