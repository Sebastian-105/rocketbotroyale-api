				<h2 title="see full docs here"><a href="/pages/index.html">What is this?</a></h2>
				<p>This website is here for anyone to check a bunch of things in rocketbotroyale</p>
				<p>Just enter in your user ID, and with that you can view your stats and your estimated skill level. Or you can enter in a certain season to view the top 50 in that season, (note: this only works with season 11-the most current season).</p>
				<p>You can also check my code to see how good you are, this code just does some simple math to get your skill based on your stats. Keep in mind this isn't always accurate, and that some players are better than their stats show, whilst others are worse.</p>
				<strong style="color: #ff3333">
					<h3>IF YOU ENTER IN YOUR USER ID WRONG IN CHECK SKILL IT BREAKS FOR A BIT</h3>
				</strong>
				<p>One last thing, say you don't know someone's user ID. You can just input their friend code and click any option it will automatically send you to a page that tell you the user ID</p>
